1* Algorithm found  : Source/predictor.py
2* Config file found: Source/config.py
All other dependent files are also found in Source/*.py (can ignore NNSource and PlotSource folder)

3* Data found: Data/*
4* Visual and Experimental Results just for intuition found: DailyResults/*, HourlyResults/*


1* contains the main function which can be run : python3 predictor.py
1* contains currently:
	Reference Algorithm
	ARIMA forcast Algorithm
	Combined ARIMA with Linear Regression Algorithm


2* contains constants that can be altered including location to store plots : Default in AlgorithmResults folder

####################################

Increase training data size: change value in config file


########Current Limitations##############

Prediction Forecast Must BE Hours = 24. This is because of LSTM implementation. ARIMA will work for <= 24

Linear Regression Algorithm will only work on KPIs that have one or more correlating KPIs. One should use Straight ARIMA,Straight LSTM or reference to model rest
